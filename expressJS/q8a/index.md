## Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Code in Node.js

Synchronous code in Node.js is executed sequentially, one statement at a time, in the order it appears in the code. This means that each statement must wait for the previous one to finish executing before it can start executing. Synchronous code is blocking, meaning that it can cause the entire program to pause while waiting for a particular operation to complete. For example, if a synchronous operation takes a long time to complete, it can block the event loop and prevent other operations from being processed, leading to poor performance and responsiveness.

Asynchronous code in Node.js, on the other hand, is executed concurrently, allowing multiple operations to be performed simultaneously without waiting for each other. Asynchronous code uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle asynchronous operations and manage the flow of control. This allows Node.js applications to perform I/O operations, such as reading files or making network requests, without blocking the event loop and causing the program to pause. Asynchronous code is non-blocking, meaning that it allows the program to continue executing while waiting for an operation to complete, improving performance and responsiveness.

In Node.js, most I/O operations are asynchronous by default, such as reading files, making network requests, or querying databases. This is because Node.js is designed to be efficient and scalable, and asynchronous code allows it to handle multiple operations concurrently.

### Example

Consider the following synchronous and asynchronous code snippets of file reading in Node.js:

#### Synchronous Code

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);
console.log('File reading completed.');
```

In the synchronous code snippet, the file is read using the `fs.readFileSync` method, which blocks the event loop until the file reading operation is completed.

#### Asynchronous Code

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
        console.log('File reading completed.');
    }
});
```

In summary, the main difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in Node.js is how they handle the flow of control and execution of operations. Synchronous code executes sequentially and blocks the event loop, while asynchronous code executes concurrently and allows the program to continue executing without waiting for operations to complete.
